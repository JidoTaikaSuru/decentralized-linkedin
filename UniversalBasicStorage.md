Universal Basic Storage  (UBS)

Assuming the earths carring capacity (or peak human) is 10 billion and human life span will never pass 150 years it would come at reasonably low cost to give every human on earth free access to 1MB of KV storage would fit on a 1TB harddrive. 

Many projects exist which have shown decentralized proof of humanity is feasible. https://proofofhumanity.id/ https://worldcoin.org/ https://www.civic.com/  and even decentralized aggregations of several proof of humanity techniques exist https://passport.gitcoin.co.  We will build uppon this work by providing a simple onboarding mechanism at first with increasing difficulty to proove your uniqueness as the system gets more populated. In all cases the KV store will return results ordered by the sum of evidence for their unique humanness. 

New born humans can gain trust score immediatly from their parents with no extenral validation required. Birth certificates may add additional trust score. 

All humans are assumed dead after 150 years. In the case that humans start to live longer than 150 years we will have time to adjust the protocol. 

In order to disincentivise sybiling there will be no reward for contributing compute or storage resources to the project. But in order to gain access to the system a node must build up its reputation. 

Nodes are responsible for checking the humanness trust score evidence before enabeling an insert. The details of the trust score algorithm will be decided by majority vote at the time of a sybil reporting by a randomly selected pannel of nodes based on the trust score algorithm they have configured. If a node has allowed insertion of data by a sybil that node will loose reputation and eventually be banned from inserting data. 

If developers can assume that each of their users will have free universal access to KV store they will use it to replace centralized systems which cost money in some cases. 

Usecases 
- Universal online profile search. We should not be subject to the rules of only a few companeis like Facebook and Linkedin to decide who can be found by our name. Everyone with UBS can store one name in full legal and short display name form to be found by all. This universal profile will then point them to any of the profiles you own on other platforms.
- UBS profile search will also give you a descriptive bio where which you can choose to be indexed by any number of keywords which fit into your 1MB storage.
- Universal inbox. Everyone can send just a few messages at a time but you can send an encrypted message to anyone because you know their public key and they can easily find any message which has tagged them. 
- Universal free DNS replacement. Owning yourname.com  or yoursmallbusiness.com can be difficult with domain squatters having a business model to snap up shrot domains.  We will offer non unique but very easily searchable domain names for everyone. And to get a unique domain name one must meet a very high humanness score and these names are then not transferable until they are released by assumed death of the user after 150 years.



Crime and Censorship 

We believe that criminal content will not be a major problem on the platform becuase everyone that stores something must identify themselves. At the very least the problem of cirminial content will be less than on Ethereum Bitcoin or any other blockchain which allows truly anonymous data insertion. 
If someone is storing fallshoods about another user (libal) that user can request a trust score increase by the person who posted it,  this will temporarily remove the content; users can only request this a limited number of times per year. 
Additionally we expect that end users will only see content through a 3rd party because most users will not run their own nodes. Each node must show all content they have and will be removed from the network if they ever censor anything. But when nodes respond to end user queries they can censor this content as they like and we expect that each country will have a major provider for accessing the content that will apply the appopriate filters for any criminal content which remains on the network similar.
